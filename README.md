### **Ethics Overview**
- **Definition**: Ethics, or moral philosophy, involves systematizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong behavior.

---

Types of Ethics with Easy Examples

1. Normative Ethics

Definition: Focuses on determining what people should do or what is morally right or wrong. It sets standards for how people ought to behave.

Example:
Imagine you see someone drop their wallet. Normative ethics would ask, “What should you do in this situation?” The moral standard says you should return the wallet because it’s the right thing to do.



2. Descriptive Ethics

Definition: Describes how people actually behave and what moral standards they claim to follow. It doesn’t judge whether their behavior is right or wrong, just observes it.

Example:
An anthropologist studies an ancient culture and notices that they believed stealing food was acceptable during famine. Descriptive ethics simply reports this behavior without deciding if it’s morally right or wrong.




In summary:

Normative ethics tells us how we should act (e.g., return the wallet).

Descriptive ethics tells us how people actually act or believe (e.g., some might keep the wallet, some might return it).

### **Branches of Normative Ethics**
1. **Teleological Ethics (Consequentialism)**
   - Emphasis: Consequences of actions.
   - Example: Deciding not to steal because it may harm societal trust.
   - **Utilitarianism**:
     - Focus: Maximizing happiness for the majority.
     - Example: "The Trolley Problem" (choosing to divert a train to save more lives).
     - Principle: Greatest happiness for the greatest number (John Stuart Mill).

2. **Deontological Ethics**
   - Emphasis: Duty and rules.
   - Focuses on **actions, not outcomes**.
   - Example: "Lying is always wrong," based on principles like the Ten Commandments.
   - Philosophers: Immanuel Kant (emphasis on reason).
   - Divine Command Theory: Actions are good if commanded by God.

3. **Virtue Ethics**
   - Emphasis: Character and virtues.
   - Focuses on **being rather than doing**.
   - Example: A virtuous person (honest, kind) reflects morality through consistent good actions.
   - Philosophers: Plato, Aristotle.
   - Key Virtues: Honesty, integrity, respectfulness.

---

### **Comparing Ethical Approaches**
1. **Lying**:
   - Consequentialism: Lying is wrong due to negative consequences.
   - Deontology: Lying is inherently wrong.
   - Virtue Ethics: Focuses on what lying indicates about one’s character.

---

### **Dimensions of Ethics**

## **Technology & Free Speech**

### **1. Introduction**
- **Quotes to Remember**:
  - "If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear." – George Orwell.
  - "I never give them hell. I just tell the truth, and they think it’s hell." – Harry S. Truman.

6. Ensuring valuable and diverse content online.

---

### **3. Changing Paradigms in Communication**
- **Regulatory Frameworks**:
  - **Print Media**: Strongest free speech protections.
  - **Broadcast Media**: Controlled by government regulations, such as content restrictions.
    - Example: Canadian content rules.
  - **Common Carriers** (e.g., ISPs): No control over content; only facilitate communication.

- **Modern Technology Challenges**:
  - Platforms like Bulletin Board Systems (BBS) and the World Wide Web do not fit neatly into traditional frameworks.

---

### **4. Constitutional Protections**
- **Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms**:
  - Section 2 guarantees:
    1. Freedom of conscience and religion.
    2. Freedom of thought, belief, opinion, and expression.

  - **Pseudonymity**: Identity hidden but potentially traceable (e.g., "Publius" in the Federalist Papers).

- **Pros**:
  - Protects whistleblowers, victims of domestic violence, and human rights activists.
- **Cons**:
  - Facilitates cybercrime, harassment, and fraud.
- **Discussion**: Should ISPs track user identities to balance free speech with accountability?

---

### **9. Spam**

### **Organized Notes on Intellectual Property**

---

### **1. Introduction to Intellectual Property**
- **Definition**: Relates to intangible creative work, not the physical form it's stored on.
  - Example: Owning a CD vs. owning the copyright to the music on the CD.
- **Types of Protection**:
  1. **Copyright**: Right to copy and create derivatives of a work.
  2. **Patent**: Right to use or recreate an invention.
  3. **Trademark**: Right to a unique identifier (word, phrase, logo).
  4. **Trade Secret**: Proprietary knowledge kept confidential.

---

### **2. Copyright**
- **Scope**:
  - Protects original, expressive works (e.g., books, music, films, software).
  - Provides exclusive rights:
    1. Copy and distribute.
    2. Produce derivative works.
    3. Public performance or display.
- **Duration**:
  - **Canada**: 50 years after the creator’s death.
- **Key Example**:
  - Literary works: Books, scripts, and computer programs.

#### **Fair Dealing (Canada)**
- Allows limited use without permission:
  1. For research, private study, news reporting, and critique.
  2. Must not significantly impact the market for the original work.
- **Six Factors**:
  - Purpose, character, amount, alternatives, nature, and effect on the market.

---

### **3. Patents**
- Protects inventions (e.g., machines, industrial processes).
- **Criteria**:
  - Must be novel, useful, and non-obvious.
- **Duration**:
  - 20 years in Canada and the US.
- **Key Case**: *Diamond v. Diehr* (1981):

  1. High-quality copying.
  2. Rapid distribution.
  3. Lower costs of duplication.
- **Historical Evolution**:
  - Example: Printing press led to the concept of copyright (Statute of Anne, 1710).

---

### **5. Music, Movies, Software, and Book Copying**
- **Music**:
  - Improved digital technologies facilitate easy sharing (e.g., Napster).
  - **Canada**:
    - Legal to make personal copies of music recordings but not to share.
- **Movies and TV**:
  - Services like RecordTV.com facilitated unauthorized recording.
- **Software**:
  - Piracy includes unauthorized reproduction and distribution.
  - **US SIIA**: Advocates for stronger protections.
- **Books**:
  - Technology enables quick and cheap copying, leading to counterfeit markets.

---

### **6. Free Software and Open Source**
- **Free Software**:
  - Advocated by Richard Stallman (e.g., GNU project, Linux).
  - **GNU General Public License (GPL)**:
    - Any derived work must also be released as free software.
- **Open Source**:
  - Pros: Transparency, community-driven improvements.
  - Cons: Less profitability for commercial entities.

---

### **7. Digital Rights Management (DRM)**
- **Purpose**:
  - Prevent unauthorized copying and sharing of digital content.
- **Example**:
  - Encryption to limit the number of copies or restrict access.

---

### **8. Software Patents**
- Initially unpatentable in the 1970s.
- Now protected if tied to physical hardware or producing physical change.
- **Controversies**:
  - Claim that patents may stifle innovation.
  - Many argue software should rely on copyright instead.

---

### **9. International Copyright**
- **Berne Convention (1886)**:
  - First international copyright agreement.
  - Protects authors' works across member countries.
- **US Entry**:
  - Joined in 1989 after aligning laws with international standards.

---

### **10. Notable Cases**
- **Music Piracy**: Napster encouraged sharing but was ruled as infringing copyright.
- **Sony v. Universal Studios (1984)**:
  - Supreme Court ruled personal recording for later viewing as fair use.
- **State Street Bank Case (1998)**:
  - Algorithms and business processes deemed patentable.

---

### **11. Questions to Reflect**
1. Should patents promote innovation or provide fair reward?
2. Can open-source models replace patent systems?
3. Are software patents essential or a barrier to progress?

---

### **Examples for Better Understanding**
- **Copyright**:
  - A novel by an author: The physical book can be sold, but the author owns the copyright.
- **Patent**:
  - An innovative drug formula: Protects the formula for 20 years.
- **Trademark**:
  - Coca-Cola logo: Protects brand identity.
